Hi thereÔºåWelcome to my websiteüëè.

## about me

I am a freelance fashion writer based in Beijing, with over a decade of experience in the fashion industry as a former journalist. Currently, I am working as a project manager, with a focus on fashion communication and brand promotion.

Beyond fashion, I am an avid reader, writer, and cinephile, engaging in stimulating discussions about books, movies, music, and coffee. I also cultivate my passion for music as an amateur classical guitarist, deeply inspired by the artistry of Xuefei Yang.
